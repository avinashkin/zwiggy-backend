### Clone Repository
You need to write the following commands on the terminal screen (in vscode) so that you can run this project locally.

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/avinashkin/zwiggy-backend.git"
```
Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd zwiggy-backend
```
Install dependencies
```bash
  npm install
```
Start the server
```bash
  npm start
```

This server should now be running on `localhost`.

### Deploy your own server

Note : Push your code into your Github Repostory 

1. Create an account in "https://render.com/" using Github
2. Click on `New + ` and select `web services`
3. Connect to the repository ( node server) which you want to deploy 
4. Now, your server will be deployed in few minutes and a url to access your server will be provided.

## Happy Coding !!!
